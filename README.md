A simple web application for fitness activities

#### How to run

## Development server

Run `npm install  &&  npm start ` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test ` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `protractor e2e/protractor.conf.js` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end2end testing capabilities.
